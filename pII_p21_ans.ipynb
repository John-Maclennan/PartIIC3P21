    "Iceland has experienced a series of glaciations over the last 3 million years. During the most recent glacial period, which ended about 12 kyr ago, an ice sheet up to 2 km in thickness covered most of the island. The presence of this ice sheet had an important influence on volcanic activity in Iceland. \n",
    "\n",
    "This effect causes clear differences in volcanic morphology between glacial and post-glacial eruptions. The relative ages of individual eruptions can therefore be estimated by inspection of volcanic morphology. Another method which has been used by Icelandic geologists to provide a stratigraphy for postglacial eruptions is known as tephrochronology. This technique relies upon the identification of well characterised tephra layers within the sequence of lava flows. Tephra is material consisting of fragments of volcanic rock of any size expelled from a volcano, but tephrochronology usually relies on ash. When such layers can be confidently associated with organic material of the same age, then it is possible to assign absolute bounds on the ages of eruptions by using <sup>14</sup>C dating. \n",

There is also an interesting video of ice-sheet evolution in a paper by [Patton et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.02.001). Then answer the following questions."

    "\n",
    "_A few different approaches are possible. Quickest is to split the dataframe into three ages using the minimum age constraints, perhaps putting in bounds at 0, 6.5, 14 kyr. Then sum the volume and divide by the age range. Another, more involved approach is to write a function that tracks through time, then checks whether an eruption could have happened at that bound. If so, add time step*(volume of eruption/possible age range) to volume sum at that time. [Figure 7 from Eksinchol et al., 2012](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7b7b9c1c-a9d6-4beb-ae79-82e00f63dcd3/ggge21894-fig-0007-m.jpg) shows another way of displaying likely variations in eruption rate._\n",

Magma may then escape from the chamber through these fractures towards the surface where an eruption will take place. Therefore, one possible mechanism for varying eruption rates is that mantle melts supplied to the crust during the glacial period are stored in magma chambers and are seldom erupted due to the difficulty in fracturing the chamber walls. However, when the glacial overburden is removed, these stored melts can be erupted to generate the early postglacial burst in volcanic activity. Activity will then return to a steady-state.\n",
